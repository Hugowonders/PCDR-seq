# PCDR-seq
This repository is a supplementary for the manuscript entitled "Characterizing the amplification of STR markers in multiplex polymerase chain displacement reaction using massively parallel sequencing". The scripts below demonstrate how to obtain STR information from pair-end Illumina FASTQ files of PCDR products for each type of amplicons ab initio. The script is an early-stage implementation, please contact the communication author of the manuscript if you encounter any bugs.

Codes in this script were tested on a AMD Ryzen PC running Ubuntu 20.04. Other UNIX/LINUX platforms are plausible but the performance is not guaranteed.

##Software installation
First, [Fastp](https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp) is adopted
